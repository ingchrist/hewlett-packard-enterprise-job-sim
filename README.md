Here is your task

To complete the task, follow the steps below:

Step 1: Begin by reviewing the page Building a RESTful Web Service in the Resources section below. This provides a tutorial for creating a basic “hello world” web service, which will allow you to meet the above requirements. Then, review How to Create a REST API using Java Spring Boot, which provides a more complex example for building a web service that manages a list of people.

Step 2: Start by downloading the source repository for the above guide, which is also included in the Resources section below.

Step 3: Create a resource class for the Employee that includes private variables for employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, and title. Also include getter functions for each variable.

Step 4: Create a resource class called Employees. This class should maintain a list of employees and support getting and setting the employee list.

Step 5: Create a class called EmployeeManager, which is responsible for initializing the Employees class. This class is where you should hard-code in 3-4 example employees.

Step 6: Add a resource controller that supports an HTTP GET request at http://localhost:8080/employees. This should return all user data.

Step 7: Build an executable version of your application, and then launch the executable file.

Step 8: Send an HTTP GET request to http://localhost:8080/employees to test that your application works as expected.
